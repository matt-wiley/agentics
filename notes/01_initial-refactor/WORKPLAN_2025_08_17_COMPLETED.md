## Single-File Architecture Strategy

To maintain simplicity while adding these improvements:

1. **Modular Classes**: Organize functionality into classes within the single file
2. **Clear Sections**: Use comment separators for different components
3. **Main Function**: Centralize initialization and execution
4. **Configuration Block**: Keep all settings at the top
5. **Test Section**: Optional embedded tests at the bottom
