## Phase 7: Advanced Memory Management üîÑ **PRIORITY**

### Task 7.1: Enhanced conversation memory (Previously Task 4.2)
**Goal**: Better context management within single file

**Current Issue**: Basic memory doesn't support learning or long conversations

**Specific Actions** (from previous workplan):
- Implement conversation summarization for long sessions
- Add semantic memory for user preferences (simple key-value)
- Create memory consolidation logic
- Add memory size limits and cleanup

**Technical Implementation Plan**:
```python
class EnhancedMemory:
    def __init__(self, max_tokens=8000, summary_threshold=4000):
        self.conversation_buffer = []
        self.semantic_memory = {}  # key-value for user preferences
        self.summary_buffer = []   # condensed conversation history
        self.max_tokens = max_tokens
        self.summary_threshold = summary_threshold
        
    def add_interaction(self, human_input, ai_response):
        """Add new interaction and check if summarization needed"""
        self.conversation_buffer.append({
            'human': human_input,
            'ai': ai_response,
            'timestamp': time.time()
        })
        if self._estimate_tokens() > self.summary_threshold:
            self._summarize_old_conversations()
            
    def _summarize_old_conversations(self):
        """Use LLM to create conversation summary"""
        # Implement intelligent summarization
        
    def get_relevant_context(self, query):
        """Retrieve relevant memory based on current query"""
        # Return recent conversations + relevant summaries + semantic memory
        
    def learn_preference(self, key, value):
        """Store user preference for future reference"""
        self.semantic_memory[key] = value
```

**Files to Modify**:
- `simplest_agent.py`: Enhance memory management section (~200-300 lines addition)
